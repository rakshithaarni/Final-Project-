Documentation for BuffaloFinalProject.html: 
The webpage BuffaloFinalProject.html has been designed based on The Guardian's website 
The code of the Guardian was used to replicate the header and the logo as well as the layout. 
The css for the same was designed keeping in mind the color scheme and placement of articles on The Guardian's webpage. 
The div and div class were created based on the size of the divs on The Guardian's webpage. 
The unique font from The Guardian's website was copied to keep the font-family and font-style consistent. 
The article was published on a page on the "Refugees" menu to keep the subject matter consistent.
The author page was linked to the author's own website -- in this case, not on The Guardian website, but on the author's personal website.
A map was created using fusion tables and embedded in the <body> to link it to the actual text. The design of the headline and source was done in the <style> section
A chart was created using Google Charts with Javascript taken from Google. This was inserted in the Javascipt section 
The Topics section in the bottom of the page was created in a div to link related topics to the story on the page. 
A section for related topics on the top-right corner has been created so that the reader can navigate to other pages on the website -- related to the content of the main story on the page. 
Interactivity across platforms was ensured using code from The Guardian's website that makes the pages available across devices.
